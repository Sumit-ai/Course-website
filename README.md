In this course, we will study the basics of Deep Learning. Generally, in other courses, the rule is first theory and then practical. In this course, I will try to cover both parts simultaneously. We will follow the learning by doing approach.

_This course is divided into the 5 lessons_: Every course will have one in-class coding assignment.  

1. **Deep Learning Introduction**
- Introduction to the IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Anaconda, **Google Colab** and Kaggle Environment. Please click here -> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qq5bEuCC8kRjKMidPuakuGKD9vkGCgKy?usp=sharing)
- Basic Python operations and funtions. 
- Perceptron: Father of Artificial Neural Network or ANN.
- theory and practical. 


2. **Introduction to python and Deep Learning libraries.**
- Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy. matplotlib (small introduction)
- First model in Tensorflow. (`hello in tensorflow`) regression and classification 


3. **Neural Network for Image classification.** 
- Convolutional neural network. 
- theory and practical. 
- save the model and reuse it. 


4. **Hyperparameter tuning and Augmentation.** 
- What are hyperparameters 
- How to tune your model 
- Augmentation using tensorflow. 


5. **Introduction to transfer learning and model deployment.**  
- ResNet-50 and ResNet-25. 
- How to deploy the model using Gradio library. 


(`In this course we will use Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab environment. `)
