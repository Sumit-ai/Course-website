In this course we will study basics of Deep Learing. Generally in other courses the rule is first theory and then practical. In this course I will try to cover both parts simulteneously. We will follow learning by doing approach.

_This course is devided into the 5 lessons_: Every course will have one in class coding assignment 

1. Deep Learning Introduction:
- Introduction to the IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
